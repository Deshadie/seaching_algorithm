Performance modeling and analysis are critical tools for ensuring the cost-effective design and 
engineering of communications and computer systems, as well as services that rely on such systems. 
Appropriate application of performance modeling and analysis techniques can provide quantitative insight 
into system performance that would be difficult, expensive, or even impossible to obtain otherwise.

Whether it is done by a computer or a human, searching takes a long time in any application. There are 
numerous algorithms in computer science that can address this problem. In this case, our system is a 
search engine, and the objective is a comprehensive performance review of various finding algorithms 
that incorporate different system behaviors.
